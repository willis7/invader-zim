=== Demo Spring Boot Groovy app

This application demonstrates how easy it is to build a Groovy Spring Boot application, using Cucumber to test. It uses embedded server and mongo during functional tests.

==== To run tests

[source]
----
gradle clean check
----

==== Set up MongoDB

Make sure that you have MongoDB installed and running. Once the `mongod` process is up and running, insert some test data into the database by running:

[source]
----
mongo invasion src/main/resources/mongo/quotes.js
----

==== To run the app from Gradle using local Mongo

[source]
----
gradle run
----

==== To run up the fat jar

[source]
----
java -jar build/libs/invader-zim
----
